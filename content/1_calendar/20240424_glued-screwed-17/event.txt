Description:

Edition 17 of Glued & Screwed will be a collaboration with The Balcony, an exhibition and curatorial platform based in The Hague and founded in 2018 by Arthur Cordier & Valentino Russo.

Itâ€™s contours, it turned out, consisted of urban life at the interplay of architecture and politics, and with that a visually striking and pertinent short-film program was quickly formed, representing an exciting mix of talented local and international filmmakers.
